# Catholic Matchmaking Service

Welcome to **CatholicMatch** – a curated Catholic matchmaking service built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). This project was bootstrapped using [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and customized to help connect like‑minded Catholic singles through a carefully managed, manual matching process.

## Overview

CatholicMatch is designed to streamline the matchmaking process:
- **Candidates** register by creating an account.
- **Administrators** (you and your wife) review candidate profiles via an admin dashboard and manually create match proposals.
- **Candidates** receive match proposals with minimal details (picture, first name, and basic info) and can respond with a green light or pass.
- When both candidates give the green light, their full contact details are revealed.
